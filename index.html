                    My name is Cole Kasabian and welcome to my Portfolio Page. I am a learning developer based out of Fresno California, who is trying to make a career out of programming. This has become more than a passion, instead it has become an obsession that I have passion for and want to continue to learn more about. It is an evolving space that you are able to use critical thinking to problem solve at the same time as learning something new nearly every day. To really get to know me though a few things I love would include, playing basketball, playing video games, spending time with people I care about, and working out. These are all things that helped shape the person I am today. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    When looking at who I want to be compared to who I am today there are some differences. What I aspire to be is someone who can take care of their family by working and giving them important life lessons. This means creating opportunity for myself by showcasing some of the work that I have accomplished so far. This is by no means an end to what I want to work on and in fact it is only the beginning. Please enjoy looking at what I have created and if you have any constructive feedback, please let me know by contacting me with the information provided at the end of my page. Thank you for visiting!
