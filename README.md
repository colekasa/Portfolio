# Portfolio

This project is made to display to others what I have done and what I will do in the future. I am looking to expand my knowledge and create more and more projects as the years go on, by myself and with teams. This will be a page where I can display some of those projects that I think are cool, or that I just worked hard on and am proud that I have completed it. The main audience of my project page is not myself. While I am glad to use this page as a journal, this site is actually more for potential employers or other coders who would like to look at some of the work that I have created. There will be a mix of everything that I have done on here but it is not the complete list of all of the projects that I have completed, if you are looking for more work that I have done please contact me and let me know that you are interested!


## ðŸš€ About Me
I am an aspiring full stack developer who is looking to expand his knowledge with each project. This is a list of the projects I worked hard on and would like to showcase to the world. I love to play basketball, workout, play lots of video games, and hangout with friends/family. Of course all of this is on my Portfolio Page, so go check it out!
